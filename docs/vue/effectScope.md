## 背景
Vueuse createSharedComposable

## [RFC 0041-reactivity-effect-scope](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/blob/master/active-rfcs/0041-reactivity-effect-scope.md)

This RFC is trying to abstract the component's setup() effect collecting and disposing feature into a more general API that can be reused outside of the component model.
